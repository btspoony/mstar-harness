# Changelog

All notable changes to the `@mstar-harness/omp` package are documented in this file.

The monorepo root [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) summarizes cross-surface releases.

## [Unreleased]

## [3.8.3] - 2026-09-12

### Changed

- Version alignment with harness **3.8.3**.

See root [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) **3.8.3**.

## [3.8.2] - 2026-09-12

### Changed

- **dsh docs**: the package README now documents the recommended `workflowNames` allowlist for the native read-only fan-out path on dsh — `mstar-qc-tri` (plan QC tri), `mstar-audit-fanout` (large-repo `/codebase-audit`), `mstar-pr-seats` (`/amazing-pr-review deep`) — with the production-overlay note in the same place: with the shipped empty allowlist every name is *unknown*, which the default `workflowGate: 'warn'` turns into one survivable `workflow.name.unknown` advisory; a deployment that also wants unknown names vetoed sets `workflowGate: 'hard'` in the profile layer. No default changed — `workflowGate` stays `'warn'` and `workflowNames` stays unset (operator overlays, never mstar defaults).
- **dsh read-only fan-out (docs)**: `skills/mstar-host/references/dsh.md` gains the **Read-only fan-out via the `workflow` tool** section and `references/dsh-workflow-scripts.md` ships the copy-pasteable `script` + `meta` templates for the three names; `commands/codebase-audit.md` and `commands/amazing-pr-review.md` carry the dsh-conditional sentence (slash → native `workflow` tool → conversation `workflow-run` node, other hosts unchanged), and `skills/mstar-sdd/SKILL.md` notes the plan QC tri MAY run through the qc-tri script while per-task implementers stay serial `subagent`.

- Version alignment with harness **3.8.2**.

See root [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) **3.8.2**.

## [3.8.1] - 2026-09-11

### Changed

- Version alignment with harness **3.8.1**.

See root [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) **3.8.1**.

## [3.8.0] - 2026-09-10

### Changed

- Version alignment with harness **3.8.0**.

See root [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) **3.8.0**.

## [3.7.3] - 2026-09-10

### Changed

- Version alignment with harness **3.7.3**.

See root [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) **3.7.3**.

## [3.7.2] - 2026-09-09

### Changed

- Moved the `mode: primary` **`project-manager`** agent shell out of the shared `agents/` subagent surface into `packages/opencode/agents/` (OpenCode-only). Host plugin surfaces (ZCode / omp / Claude-plugin manifests) no longer register PM as a subagent — PM entry stays via the `pm` skill; OpenCode bundling merges the shell into `harness-agents/`.
- Updated omp/dsh mirror contracts and host docs to match.

- Version alignment with harness **3.7.2**.

See root [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) **3.7.2**.

## [3.7.1] - 2026-09-09

### Changed

- **ZCode coordination-write gate**: new engine-backed PreToolUse (`Write|Edit`) process hook `hooks/mstar-write-gate.mjs` — hard-enforced repos block writes to harness coordination documents (status.json, workflow snapshots, project registers) with exit 2 plus an actionable stderr reason (stdout stays empty); soft-mode and non-harness writes pass silently; disable per session with `MSTAR_WRITE_GATE=off`.
- **Edits validate the reconstructed post-edit result (ZCode host)**: deterministic Edits (`old_string` + `new_string` with a unique match, or `replace_all`) are validated against the reconstructed content instead of the pre-edit on-disk state — a deterministic corrupting edit now blocks under hard enforcement; ambiguous or non-reconstructible edits keep the pre-edit fallback.
- **Oversized coordination docs are now a violation on the ZCode host**: content or on-disk targets beyond the 2 MiB validation budget yield `status.oversized` (hard-mode block naming the escape hatch instead of a silent pass; omp keeps the default silent pass).
- **omp hook lazy loaders removed (versioned divergence)**: the engine is inlined at build, so a stale engine dist now fails the omp build instead of silently degrading; Gate-1 block/pass decisions and reason strings are unchanged (golden fixture matrix).

- Version alignment with harness **3.7.1**.

## [3.6.0-alpha.4] - 2026-09-03

### Changed

- Initial `@mstar-harness/omp` package: the omp hook + six `mstar_*` tools (moved from the repo root) bundled with the engine **inlined**, plus `skills/`/`commands/`/`agents/` mirrors — `omp plugin install @mstar-harness/omp` works without any local build.

See root [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) **3.6.0-alpha.4**.
