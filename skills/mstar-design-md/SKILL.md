description: DESIGN.md design system specification for Morning Star projects. Create, audit, and maintain project-level design tokens (Colors, Typography, Spacing, Elevation, Motion, Shapes, Components, Voice & Content) using Vercel Geist as reference template. Three-level completeness checklist (MVP/Standard/Production) with built-in upgrade placeholders. Supports light/dark dual-theme via DESIGN.md + DESIGN.dark.md sharing same token names with different values. Prepare 阶段由 @architect 主责创建，@product-manager 提供设计需求；@frontend-dev / @fullstack-dev 实现 UI 时消费；@qc-specialist / @qa-engineer 审查 UI 对齐 DESIGN.md。Read when PM assigns DESIGN.md creation in Prepare, initiating a new UI project, @architect defining a design system, implementing styled components, auditing UI against design spec, adding dark theme, or user mentions "DESIGN.md" / "design tokens" / "design system". Phase gate → **mstar-phase-gates**; paths → **mstar-plan-conventions**.

## Load order

**Before first Read of this skill: Read `mstar-harness-core` (SKILL.md).** For Prepare phase integration and gate rules, read `mstar-phase-gates`. For plan directory paths (`{HARNESS_DIR}`, `{SPECS_DIR}`), read `mstar-plan-conventions`. On conflict, **`mstar-harness-core` wins**.

| 你还可能要 Read | 何时 |
|-----------------|------|
| `mstar-phase-gates` | Prepare 阶段判定 gate、何时 DESIGN.md 必须就绪 |
| `mstar-plan-conventions` | `{HARNESS_DIR}` / `{SPECS_DIR}` 路径解析 |
| `mstar-roles` | `@architect` / `@product-manager` / `@frontend-dev` / `@qc-specialist` / `@qa-engineer` 角色职责边界 |
| `mstar-coding-behavior` | 实现角色消费 DESIGN.md 前的通用编码约束 |

## Scope (DESIGN.md lifecycle)

| Topic | See |
|-------|-----|
| Normative spec: section definitions, token naming, light/dark rules | `references/design-md-spec.md` |
| Three-level completeness checklist (MVP / Standard / Production) | `references/completeness-checklist.md` |
| Vercel Geist DESIGN.md as annotated reference | `references/vercel-example.md` |
| Full template with Level 2/3 placeholders | `templates/DESIGN.md.template` |
| Dark theme template (same token names, different values) | `templates/DESIGN.dark.md.template` |

**Out of scope:** rendered UI artifacts (use Open Design MCP `user-open-design`); frontend implementation that consumes DESIGN.md tokens (use `@frontend-dev` / `@fullstack-dev`); QC review verdict rules (→ **`mstar-review-qc`**).

## Location

- **Primary**: project root `DESIGN.md` (human + agent visible, aligns with `AGENTS.md`)
- **Dark theme**: project root `DESIGN.dark.md` (same token names, different values)
- `DESIGN.md` is a **project-level design contract**, not a harness internal artifact. It lives beside `README.md` and `AGENTS.md`.

## Role lifecycle

### Creator: `@architect` (primary) + `@product-manager` (requirements)

`@architect` owns DESIGN.md content — token selection, naming, completeness level decisions. `@product-manager` provides design intent: brand identity, target audience, must-have UI patterns, accessibility requirements.

### Orchestrator: `@project-manager`

In Prepare phase, PM decides whether the project needs a DESIGN.md. If yes, dispatches to `@architect` with product requirements from `@product-manager`. PM checks DESIGN.md exists and meets the assigned completeness level before `plan(locked)`.

### Consumers

- `@frontend-dev` / `@fullstack-dev` — read DESIGN.md before implementing styled components; map tokens to CSS/theme variables
- `@qc-specialist` — verify UI implementation aligns with DESIGN.md tokens
- `@qa-engineer` — verify visual output matches design spec

## Phase gate integration

DESIGN.md is a **Prepare-stage artifact** (like spec). It must be created and reviewed before `plan(locked)` for any plan that includes UI work.

1. PM includes "DESIGN.md creation/audit" in Prepare tracking checklist when the plan involves UI
2. `@architect` creates or updates DESIGN.md; `@product-manager` reviews design intent alignment
3. PM gates on: DESIGN.md exists, meets completeness level declared in plan, `@product-manager` signed off

For **hotfix** or plans with no UI changes, DESIGN.md check may be skipped.

## Completeness levels

DESIGN.md supports three levels, each with built-in upgrade path:

1. **Level 1 — MVP** (minimal, prevents guesswork): palette, base typography, spacing scale
2. **Level 2 — Standard** (consistent components): full token scales, breakpoints, component tokens (Button, Input)
3. **Level 3 — Production** (complete design system): dual theme, elevation, motion, shapes, component library, voice

The template includes all levels; Level 2 and 3 sections are commented out with `<!-- LEVEL2_PLACEHOLDER: ... -->` markers that explain when to activate them. The audit workflow detects these placeholders and can recommend upgrade.

Full checklist → `references/completeness-checklist.md`.

## Workflows

### Workflow 1: Create DESIGN.md (Prepare phase)

1. Read `references/design-md-spec.md` for section definitions
2. Copy `templates/DESIGN.md.template` to `{PROJECT_ROOT}/DESIGN.md`
3. Interview `@product-manager` for brand colors, typography preferences, must-have patterns
4. Fill Level 1 sections; leave Level 2/3 as-is (commented placeholders)
5. If plan requires Level 2+ out of the gate, fill those sections too
6. Run the completeness audit workflow below to confirm level
7. Report to PM: path created, level achieved, what's needed for next level

### Workflow 2: Audit DESIGN.md completeness

1. Read `DESIGN.md` and `DESIGN.dark.md` (if exists)
2. Load `references/completeness-checklist.md`
3. Check each checklist item; note gaps
4. Report:
   - Current completeness level
   - Gaps preventing next level
   - Presence of upgrade placeholders (`LEVEL2_PLACEHOLDER`, `LEVEL3_PLACEHOLDER`)
   - Recommendation: whether to upgrade now or defer
5. Update DESIGN.md level tag (e.g., `<!-- COMPLETENESS_LEVEL: 1 -->`) if changed

### Workflow 3: Add dark theme

1. Read existing `DESIGN.md` to extract token names
2. Copy `templates/DESIGN.dark.md.template` to `{PROJECT_ROOT}/DESIGN.dark.md`
3. For each token in DESIGN.md, define the dark-theme equivalent value
4. Preserve same token names; only values change (see `references/design-md-spec.md` § Light/Dark rules)
5. Audit with Workflow 2 to confirm Level 3 completeness

### Workflow 4: Consume DESIGN.md (implementation roles)

Before writing styled UI code:
1. Read `DESIGN.md` (and `DESIGN.dark.md` if exists)
2. Extract tokens into implementation layer (CSS custom properties, Tailwind config, theme object, etc.)
3. Follow DESIGN.md Voice & Content rules for copy text
4. If DESIGN.md is missing or incomplete, report to PM — do not guess tokens

## Light/Dark dual-theme rules

Dual theme uses **same token names, different values** across two files:

```
DESIGN.md         DESIGN.dark.md
-----------       --------------
gray-100: #fff    gray-100: #111
gray-1000: #000   gray-1000: #eee
```

- Token names are the **SSOT interface** — consumers reference tokens by name, not raw values
- `references/design-md-spec.md` § Light/Dark rules defines the contract

## Open Design integration

If `user-open-design` MCP is available:
- DESIGN.md is the **design intent** (tokens + rules)
- Open Design manages **rendered artifacts** (HTML/CSS/JSX previews)
- When DESIGN.md is updated, recommend syncing the Open Design project to reflect new tokens
- DESIGN.md does not replace Open Design; they are complementary
